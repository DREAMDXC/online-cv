I received my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China, in 2017, and my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China, in 2020 and 2024, respectively. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University.

My research interests include Power-Meteorology Coupling Modeling and Power-Carbon Collaborative Optimization.
