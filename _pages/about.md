I am currently a postdoctoral researcher of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University (supervised by Prof. Shengwei Mei).

I received my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China, in 2017 (supervised by Prof. Shan Cheng), and my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China, in 2020 and 2024, respectively (supervised by Prof. Yingyun Sun).

My research interests include Power-Meteorology Coupling Modeling and Power-Carbon Collaborative Optimization.
